  summary: 'Automatic Forecasting Procedure'
  description: |
    Implements a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an
    additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly and weekly
    seasonality, plus holidays. It works best with daily periodicity data with
    at least one year of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data,
    shifts in the trend, and large outliers.
